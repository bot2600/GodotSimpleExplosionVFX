A very simple way to setup realistic explosions in the Godot game engine that react to lighting.

## Dependencies
- Godot 3.2 Beta 2 (https://godotengine.org/)

(and, if you want to create the sprites yourself:)
- Blender 2.80 (https://www.blender.org/)
- Some software to assemble the animation into a spritesheet (I used Texture Packer - https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker )

## How to use
- Open the project in GodotFiles/Explosion in Godot
